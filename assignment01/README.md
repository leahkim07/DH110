  <h2> DH110: User Interface and Design </h2>
  <p> Through this project, I want to improve the heuristics of a music learning website, especially from the perspective of a middle-age man. I want to          ensure that the website is easily accessible and usable for all to use while maintaining its core purpose. I hope to simplify it while expanding on it in terms of features. This will be achieved over the rest of the quarter step-by-step. </p>

 <h2> Website 1: Dolmetsch Online </h2>
  <img src="https://leahkim07.github.io/DH110/images/Dolmetsch Screenshot.png" width="700" alt=""> <br>
  URL: <a href="https://www.dolmetsch.com/index.htm" target="_blank"> https://www.dolmetsch.com/index.htm </a> <br>
  <p> This website was created for music reading learning purposes. It has sheet music, a music dictionary, music theory, and more to allow for someone to teach themselves about what they want to know about music. My evaluation of this website is that it is very poor because the text is small, the layout is disorganzied, and the colors are not visually pleasing. You also need to do some clicking around before you can actually get to what you are looking for, so it is not easy to use as well. I believe this website needs substantial improvements for a middle-aged or older man to use. </p>
  
<h3> Heuristic Evaluation of Dolmetsch Online </h3>
  
  <h4> 1. Visibility of system status </h4>
  Definition: Within a fair length of time, users should be informed of system operations with easy-to-understand and highly visible status presented on the screen. <br><br>
  Evaluation: On this website, there is no visibility of system status at all. I could not locate it anywhere, so it is not available for users. Therefore, users are not informed about what is going on with the site or received appropriate feedback in reasonable time. To address this, I would simply add a system status feature, as this website did not have one at all. <br><br>
  Severity Rating: 3 <br>
  
  <h4> 2. Match between system and the real world </h4>
  Definition: Based on who their target consumers are, designers should try to mimic the language and concepts they would encounter in the actual world. Information should be presented in a logical order, and users' expectations should be based on their real-world experiences. This will lessen cognitive strain and make systems easier to use. <br><br>
  Evaluation: This site targets a general audience while having a classical feel due to music history and theory, but it seems very outdated and out of touch with modern systems. It is pretty disorganized, so information is all over the place, and on some parts, the text is grainy. Some of the language is out of the normal dialect for many users as well. It does NOT match the real world in my opinion. To fix this, I would use different words that mean the same thing but are more commonly used, I would update the visual feautures to be more modern and organized, and I would fix image resolution by using different images or sizing it accordingly. <br><br>
  Severity Rating: 3 <br>
  
  <h4> 3. User control and freedom </h4>
  Definition: Provide consumers with a digital area where they can take backward movements, such as undoing and redoing earlier actions. <br><br>
  Evaluation: I was not able to find where I can undo or redo actions, but a lot of links opened in a separate tab, which is always useful to access the previous page with ease. Much of the back and forth had to be done with the browser features or clicking to go back and forth rather than the website itself. Also, many links were broken, and you had to click back in the website to go back. I would add a feature to toggle back and forth between features. I would also add a return to main page or home button to go back to the main page. <br><br>
  Severity Rating: 3 <br>
  
  <h4> 4. Consistency and standards </h4>
  Definition: Designers must make sure that graphic elements and vocabulary are consistent across platforms. When used on a different screen, an icon that symbolizes one category or notion should not represent a different category or concept. <br><br>
  Evaluation: While lacking in other aspects, the site does remain consistent across graphic elements and vocabulary. There are no discrepancies with these when going through multiple different pages. No solutions are necessary. <br><br>
  Severity Rating: 1 <br>
  
  <h4> 5. Error prevention </h4>
  Definition: Design systems in such a way that potential errors are minimized to a minimal whenever possible. Users dislike being asked to identify and solve problems that are sometimes beyond their scope of knowledge. Error prevention can be accomplished by either eliminating or flagging actions that may result in errors. <br><br>
  Evaluation: There are an excess of errors on Dolmetsch. For example, clicking on headers of drop down menus for every single item results in an error. You must click on a drop down item or else it won't function as intended. This a repeated error that must be addressed. When going through sheet music, there are also a bunch of links that open up an empty page and does not direct you anywhere or automatically download any material. Again, this is found throughout various links on the website. There are also many redundant pages that repeat itself or serve no purpose. Case in point, there are tabs where it says "No longer in use." These should be easily removed. I believe this could be an easy fix by removing all of the broken links, empty pages, and redundant pages. After that, I can fix the navigation menu by adding proper links where necessary. <br><br>
  Severity Rating: 3 <br>
  
  <h4> 6. Recognition rather than recall </h4>
  Definition: Maintain task-relevant information in the display while users explore the interface to reduce cognitive stress. Because short-term memory is limited, designers should make sure that users can rely on recognition rather than memorizing facts throughout the dialogue. Recognizing something is always easier than recalling it because recognition entails detecting signs that allow us to dig into our extensive memory and bring up relevant knowledge. <br><br>
  Evaluation: It is hard to tell where you have been on the website since there is no way of telling with visual cues. However, there are slight indicators like hovering over text that changes colors, which does help. Besides this, it is very difficult to track where you have been on the website and where you are going. I would address this by adding more hovering and clicking features to indicate previous visit or adding a note of last visit. <br><br>
  Severity Rating: 2 <br>
  
  <h4> 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use </h4>
  Definition: As the number of users grows, so does the demand for fewer interactions and faster navigation. Abbreviations, function keys, hidden commands, and macro facilities can all be used to accomplish this. Users should be able to adjust or tailor the interface to their specific needs, allowing them to do routine tasks in a more convenient manner. <br><br>
  Evaluation: Shortcut keys are not very usable on this website. There were no abbreviations, function keys, or hidden commands as well. A lot of the website requires manual scrolling back and forth to see what you want to see. I would fix this by adding a return to home or return to top/bottom button for increased user experience. I could also allow for tabbing by adding html features. <br><br>
  Severity Rating: 3 <br>
  
  <h4> 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design </h4>
  Definition: Reduce the amount of clutter.Â All useless information competes for the user's limited attentional resources, potentially preventing relevant information from being retrieved from memory. As a result, the display should be pared down to simply the elements required for the current tasks, with obvious and unambiguous means of navigating to additional content. <br><br>
  Evaluation: Text is extremely cluttered. It is not distinct and organized, so it is difficult to read. Images are located in awkward positions and sometimes do not match corresponding text. There are an excess of elements that are unneccesary and do not function properly. To correct this, text should be reduced and shortened to relevant information. Images should be realigned and removed if irrelevant. Other elements should also be removed. <br><br>
  Severity Rating: 3 <br>
  
  <h4> 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors </h4>
  Definition: Because designers should presume that consumers are unable to comprehend technical jargon, error messages should almost always be written in plain English to ensure that nothing is lost in translation. <br><br>
  Evaluation: There are plenty of errors on Dolmetsch. When these errors occur, rather than an error message, there is an error page. It just says "URL not found" without further explanation. This is not helpful to users, especially those unfamiliar with technical things, so this is lacking. I would add an error message that would redirect the user to the home page to improve upon this. <br><br>
  Severity Rating: 3 <br>
  
  <h4> 10. Help and documentation </h4>
  Definition: We want users to be able to navigate the system without having to consult the manual. Documentation may be required, depending on the type of solution. When users ask for assistance, make sure it's easy to find, relevant to the work at hand, and written in a way that will lead them through the steps necessary to solve the problem. <br><br>
  Evaluation: There is no help page on the website that addresses common questions and such. However, there is a questionnaire form, but the creator of the website has stopped its operation. The page is simply there, but the text says it is no longer taking questions. If a user had any questions or concerns, no resources would be available for them. Adding even a FAQ page would be very helpful to address common questions and help users out while using this website. <br><br>

 <h2> Website 2: Teoria </h2>
  <img src="https://leahkim07.github.io/DH110/images/Teoria Screenshot.png" width="700" alt=""> <br>
  URL: <a href="https://www.teoria.com" target="_blank"> https://www.teoria.com </a> <br>
  <p> This website was created for music theory learning. It has tutorials and exercises of music theory for someone to teach themselves about what they want to know about music. My evaluation of this website is that it is pretty good because there are many good features, but some can be improved upon. I believe this website needs slight improvements for a middle-aged or older man to use. </p>
  
  <h3> Heuristic Evaluation of Teoria </h3>
  
  <h4> 1. Visibility of system status </h4>
  Evaluation: You can track where you are in a video tutorial, as you can see where you are in a video on YouTube. With exercises, you can see numerically how far along you have gone. However these are the only main visibility features, and they can be expaneded upon. I would add a progress bar for both tutorials and exercises that allows for better visual cues of progress. <br><br>
  Severity Rating: 2 <br>
  
  <h4> 2. Match between system and the real world </h4>
  Evaluation: The language used is very user-friendly at introducing musical terms to someone without background knowledge. The features on the website are also all relevant. <br><br>
  Severity Rating: 1 <br>
  
  <h4> 3. User control and freedom </h4>
   Evaluation: Undoing and redoing actions are difficult in the exercise setting because you are stuck in the exercise once started. In tutorials, it is easier to drag back and forth to watch certain parts of videos again or skip through if necessary. For exercises, I would add a pause button or something that helps save progress so you are not stuck there after opening. <br><br>
  Severity Rating: 2 <br>
  
  <h4> 4. Consistency and standards </h4>
  Evaluation: The website is extremely consistent all throughout. Navigating through various pages, everything remained the same format. Icons remained consistent as well. <br><br>
  Severity Rating: 1 <br>
  
  <h4> 5. Error prevention </h4>
  Evaluation: In terms of error prevention, this can be seen when you choose an incorrect answer for a question, and there is a message that explains why it is wrong and the right answer. This is pretty well done. <br><br>
  Severity Rating: 1 <br>
  
  <h4> 6. Recognition rather than recall </h4>
  Evaluation: There is very good recognition on the site as text or boxes have a different color when clicked on or selected, so users can tell clearly what they have chosen. <br><br>
  Severity Rating: 1 <br>
  
  <h4> 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use </h4>
  Evaluation: Abbrevations, function keys, and hidden commands are not used on this website, but I don't think it is absolutely necessary for its purpose. However, there can be added features like shortcuts to help navigate different pages while scrolling and flipping through tabs, like return to top, return to home, etc. <br><br>
  Severity Rating: 2 <br>
  
  <h4> 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design </h4>
  Evaluation: The design of this website is very sleek and organized, while visually pleasing. Nothing needs to be improved upon. <br><br>
  Severity Rating: 1 <br>
  
  <h4> 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors </h4>
  Evaluation: Like mentioned previously, error messages allows for users to evaluate why the error was made and provides an explanation to the error as well. <br><br>
  Severity Rating: 1 <br>
  
  <h4> 10. Help and documentation </h4>
  Evaluation: Teoria provides a help page which has frequently asked questions and how to use the website and about the website as well. All of these are organized for the user to navigate. <br><br>
  Severity Rating: 1 <br>
