Improving User Experiences for Music Learning <h1>
  Leah Kim <h3>
  DH110: User Interface and Design <h3>
  <p> Through this project, I want to improve the heuristics of a music learning website, especially from the perspective of a middle-age man. I want to          ensure that the website is easily accessible and usable for all to use while maintaining its core purpose. I hope to simplify it while expanding on it in terms of features. This will be achieved over the rest of the quarter step-by-step. </p>

 Website 1: Dolmetsch Online <h3>

  URL: https://www.dolmetsch.com/index.htm <br>
  <p> This website was created for music reading learning purposes. It has sheet music, a music dictionary, music theory, and more to allow for someone to teach themselves about what they want to know about music. My evaluation of this website is that it is very poor because the text is small, the layout is disorganzied, and the colors are not visually pleasing. You also need to do some clicking around before you can actually get to what you are looking for, so it is not easy to use as well. I believe this website needs substantial improvements for a middle-aged or older man to use. </p>
  
Heuristic Evaluation of Dolmetsch Online <h4>
  1. Visibility of system status <b> <br>
  Definition: Within a fair length of time, users should be informed of system operations with easy-to-understand and highly visible status presented on the screen. <br><br>
  Evaluation: On this website, there is no visibility of system status at all. I could not locate it anywhere, so it is not available for users. Therefore, users are not informed about what is going on with the site or received appropriate feedback in reasonable time. On a 1-10 scale, I would rate it a 1. To address this, I would simply add a system status feature, as this website did not have one at all. <br><br>
  2. Match between system and the real world <b> <br>
  Definition: Based on who their target consumers are, designers should try to mimic the language and concepts they would encounter in the actual world. Information should be presented in a logical order, and users' expectations should be based on their real-world experiences. This will lessen cognitive strain and make systems easier to use. <br><br>
  Evaluation: This site targets a general audience while having a classical feel due to music history and theory, but it seems very outdated and out of touch with modern systems. It is pretty disorganized, so information is all over the place, and on some parts, the text is grainy. Some of the language is out of the normal dialect for many users as well. It does NOT match the real world in my opinion. I would rate it a 3/10. To fix this, I would use different words that mean the same thing but are more commonly used, I would update the visual feautures to be more modern and organized, and I would fix image resolution by using different images or sizing it accordingly. <br><br>
  3. User control and freedom <b> <br>
  Definition: Provide consumers with a digital area where they can take backward movements, such as undoing and redoing earlier actions. <br><br>
  Evaluation: I was not able to find where I can undo or redo actions, but a lot of links opened in a separate tab, which is always useful to access the previous page with ease. Much of the back and forth had to be done with the browser features or clicking to go back and forth rather than the website itself. Also, many links were broken, and you had to click back in the website to go back. I rate it a 4/10. I would add a feature to toggle back and forth between features. I would also add a return to main page or home button to go back to the main page. <br><br>
  4. Consistency and standards <b> <br>
  Definition: Designers must make sure that graphic elements and vocabulary are consistent across platforms. When used on a different screen, an icon that symbolizes one category or notion should not represent a different category or concept. <br><br>
  Evaluation: While lacking in other aspects, the site does remain consistent across graphic elements and vocabulary. There are no discrepancies with these when going through multiple different pages. I rate it a 10/10. No solutions are necessary. <br><br>
  5. Error prevention <b> <br>
  Definition: Design systems in such a way that potential errors are minimized to a minimal whenever possible. Users dislike being asked to identify and solve problems that are sometimes beyond their scope of knowledge. Error prevention can be accomplished by either eliminating or flagging actions that may result in errors. <br><br>
  Evaluation: There are an excess of errors on Dolmetsch. For example, clicking on headers of drop down menus for every single item results in an error. You must click on a drop down item or else it won't function as intended. This a repeated error that must be addressed. When going through sheet music, there are also a bunch of links that open up an empty page and does not direct you anywhere or automatically download any material. Again, this is found throughout various links on the website. There are also many redundant pages that repeat itself or serve no purpose. Case in point, there are tabs where it says "No longer in use." These should be easily removed. I give a rating of 1/10. I believe this could be an easy fix by removing all of the broken links, empty pages, and redundant pages. After that, I can fix the navigation menu by adding proper links where necessary. <br><br>
  6. Recognition rather than recall <b> <br>
