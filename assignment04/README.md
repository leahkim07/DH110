# Personas and Scenarios

### The Purpose of Storytelling

Researchers and designers are reminded through UX Storytelling that the experience must be user-centered. UX storytelling allows researchers to reflect on the underlying feelings and desires that users may have when completing a task and ensure that they are satisfied by the project's results by using think no longer websites based on heuristic principles and user interviews as data points. By designing personas, I will be able to think more broadly about the target consumers and better understand how the current system fails to satisfy their needs.

### Design Features 

Using information from previous testing, I plan to implement 3 design features to improve usability: 
* **Progress Tracker:** allow for music learners to keep track of their learning and progress by mapping out important topics and including subtopics with a progress bar to see how far along they have come
* **Filter Function:** create an extensive possibility of filter options and categorize them easily based on needs that users may have when searching for musical topics. This will allow them to easily narrow down their choices from the thousands of options available to them on the internet. Some examples of those filters are: genre of music, lesson type, sheet music, etc. 
* **Skills Tester:** to help people with previous music knowledge and expereince understand what are their needs and place them in the appropriate level of study.

### Scenarios & Journey Map

While all functions I plan to improve in my project can be used by each personal to reach their goals, I have prefered to create a scenario for each function that highighted how it could help one of the persona at least achieve their goals and meet their needs. 

#### 1. Mark's Scenario - The Progress Tracker

> *This progress tracker allows for music learners to keep track of their learning and progress by mapping out important topics and including subtopics with a progress bar to see how far along they have come.*

#### 2. Ellie's Scenario - The Filter Function

> *The filters and categorization features create an extensive possibility of ways to filter through all the  options available on the internet easily based on needs that users may have when searching about music. This will allow them to easily narrow down their choices from the thousands of options available to them on the internet. Some examples of those filters are: genre of music, lesson type, sheet music, etc.*

### Reflection

* I had fun creating personas, as it helped me better understand why the users would use the features and the positive impact it will have on their music learning journey.

* My limitation was that I was somewhat restricted in what I was able to research for each demographic, but I asked around online to have personal stories provided by those who meet those demographics to supplement information.

* From this research, I was able to understand how I should focus on resolving any frustration in the music learning process.

* This confirmed that the three design features would be very useful to implement on the website.
