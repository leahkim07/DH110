# Personas and Scenarios

### The Purpose of Storytelling

UX Storytelling reminds the researchers and designers that the experience must be user-centered. By think no longer websites based on heuristic principles and user interviews as data points, UX storytelling allows researcher to reflect on the underlying feeling and desires that users may have when completing the task and assuring that those are being satisfied by the results of the project. By creating personas, I will be able to think as the target users more generally and understand better how the current system in place does not meet their goals.

### Design Features 

Based on my previous research, I plan to implement 3 design features that I believe will help users feel incentive to workout and more confident in their choices of workout: 
* **Filters:** create an extensive possibility of filter options and categorize them easily based on needs that users may have when working out. This will allow them to  easily narrow down their choices from the thousands of options available to them on the internet. Some examples of those filters are: type of workout, level of intensity, lengths, targeted area of the body, equipment needed, type of workout (images, videos, prerecorded, live, in person, virtual), price, etc.
* **Social reviews:** the ability to have an account on the site and interact with other of the site members through chats and trusted reviews. Like the Sephora website, the reviews will give some description of who the reviewer is in order to see what people similar to you have said about the particular workout and help you see if it may fit your needs. It creates a more social component that currently cannot be recreated due to the social distancing. 
* **Quiz function:** to help beginners or people with recent changes in their capabilities (injuries, pregnancies etc.) understand what are their needs and offer them initial options to see which they like and do not like.

### Scenarios & Journey Map

While all functions I plan to improve in my project can be used by each personal to reach their goals, I have prefered to create a scenario for each function that highighted how it could help one of the persona at least achieve her goals and meet her needs. 

#### 1. June's Scenario - the quiz function

> *This detail quiz feature will help beginners or people with recent changes in their capabilities (injuries, pregnancies etc.) understand what are their needs and offer them initial options to see which they like and dislike based on workouts that are perfect for them.*

June is now actively looking to start working out. She has asked some friends about what they like to do and they have all told her different answers ranging from yoga to running to Zumba. While June has heard of these different types of workout before, she has no clue which one she would like and what benefits each have for her body.

 Because of COVID-19, going to her local gyms and seeing what they offered was not a possibility so she turned to the internet and planned to workout from the comfort of her own home. However, she had no clue what to research and didn’t know what equipment she needed or how long she should clearly workout for. She was completely lost and felt like she didn’t know how to start. 

She then found Fitness for All and clicked on their quiz. Within the next 10 minutes, she was able to understand and put into words what she wanted, what she thinks she likes and dislikes as well as how equipped she is. She then created a profile that offered her various types of workouts that matched her criteria and allowed her to try it workout and create a feedback loop once complete. The more she tried out workouts given to her by the quiz, the more she knew what was working for her, and the more the website would give her accurate results for her. 

This was a blessing as June had no idea that pilates was what she liked the most and was able to develop a really joy in doing it daily and staying in shape. Feeling satisfied of working out and how easy if finally became, she was able to stay in shape and go enjoy quality time with her grand children.

#### 2. Mary's Scenario - the social aspect

> *The filters and categorization features create an extensive possibility of ways to filter through all the  options available on the internet easily based on needs that users may have when working out. This will allow them to easily narrow down their choices from the thousands of options available to them on the internet. Some examples of those filters are: type of workout, level of intensity, lengths, equipment needed, etc.* 

Mary use to love going early in the morning to group fitness classes at her local gym. She had friends there and a sharp schedule that kept her motivated to workout. However with the stay at home order, her gym shut-down and she was unable to participate in those anymore. Alone at-home, she lack the motivation to workout every other day. Additionally, she didn’t know what type of exercises she like. She usually picked workout based on what her friends at the gym recommended as she loved the ambiance of working out with them and motivating one and other. 

She recently decided she wanted to be her own motivator and workout again with online classes but failed without the support of others. She then realized she needed to find live virtual classes where there was other attendees that way she could feel more incline to join and feel like she is a part of the class. However, after going online and searching for those classes, she didn’t find anything that looked like what was at the gym. Most live classes were bootcamps made for young and very athletic people she thought and became discourage once again. 

She then found Fitness for All and saw that they had live classes. Additionally all classes had reviews on them with information about the people behind the review (age, gender, level of intensity, preferred workouts, etc.) Through that she was able to find people that were similar than her and what classes they were taking. She joined a live class or two and was pleased to see that for those live classes there was a group chat features where participants can chat during the week and motivate one and other. 

Mary felt happy to finally feel motivated to workout again through a social workout experience online. She felt amaze to workout with people around the country and to finally have a clear workout schedule. The social component of Fitness for All really helped her figure out what classes she may enjoy and find an online community to encourage her to workout again.

#### 3. Evalyn's Scenario - the filter function
 
 > *The social feature of Fitness for All enable users to have an account on the site and interact with other  site members through chats and trusted reviews. The reviews will give some description of who the reviewer is in order to see what people with similar goals think about the particular workout. It creates a more social component that currently does not exist in fitness due to the social distancing.*

 Evalyn is currently balancing her new at-home work schedule and having two teenagers at-home taking classes online. After sitting all day long, she wants to workout but feels like she never has the time. On top of that she injured her knee recently and cannot do her typical workouts. Even before covid, she use to workout at home cuz she did not like her local gym and didn’t want to waste time commuting to another gym. She likes switching up her at home routines and need various lengths of workout to squeeze into her face-pace life. 

Because of her always busy home and her knee injury, she has been less able to workout but is now looking to take more time for herself. However, she is faced with so many options on the internet and is still unsure about what she can and cannot do with her knee. Her doctor told her that she could workout again but take things easy. So she goes on Google and tries to find the perfect workouts to match all her criteria. She gets overwhelmed by the amount of search results and now how to slowly go through all of them which she does not have time to do. Hence, she feels stuck and unable to workout as she lacks the time do research. 

One day, her friends mention to her Fit for All and its extensive list of classes that are categorize methodically to make it easy for her to understand everything she needs to know about a workout within seconds. She heads to the website and filters out exactly based on her specific needs (at-home, prerecorded, with equipment, short length, advance level, with a knee injury). She then only gets the relevant workouts and within minutes she is able to understand what each of these results involve and can save them for future workouts. 

Evalyn feels relieved and excited to be able to workout again as it was something that she cherished in the past. She can now take the little amount of free time she has in her day to workout. By working out and having an easy way to find new fitness programs, she is able to destress and feel happier.

### Reflection

* I truly enjoyed creating personas, especially the empathy maps as it helped me better understand why the users would use the features I am planning to create and the positive impact it will have on their fitness journey.

* My only limitation was that I felt I did not have enough demographic information about each as well as their abilities to truly research online. Next time, I would like to go more in-depth about that. 

* From this research, I was able to understand how my product should focus on resolving any frustration in the fitness process my user had (user-centric approach).

* Additionally, it reaffirms the validity of the needs for more filters, a quiz and a social component to fitness apps which is the key features of my project.
