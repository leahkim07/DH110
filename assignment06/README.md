## Impression Test:
Here is the link to the [impression testing](). For this round of testing, I gave the user 5 seconds to look at the first screen and asked for her general impression of the site. Then, I showed her the screen variations and asked her to compare it to the first screen, pointing out things she liked or disliked about each variation.


### Findings:
**Overall Impression:**
> The user could 

**Typography:**
> The user preferred 

**Shape:**
> The user indicated 

**Color Scheme:**
> The user preferred the light mode design over the dark mode. He stated that he was more used to using light mode, especially when it comes to reading 
information-heavy sites. He also pointed out that the color scheme for light mode was more compatible; the light blue background complimented the bright blue buttons well. In contrast, he felt that the dark color in the dark mode design did not match the vibrancy of the buttons and in exchange, created a stark, but awkward contrast.


## Revisions:
**Color Contrast**
> While testing color contrast on my original design, I noticed that the button to background contrast was inadequate. Therefore, I took one of the color variations and modified it, so it would pass the contrast tests.
> I could have also used the same design, but with a border around each box.

## Design Decisions:
**Typeface:**
> I chose 
**Color Scheme:** 
> I took inspiration from the original website, but due to color contrast, I modified to my own color preferences from there. I wanted a classy and simple look, so I went with the selected colors.

**Layout Grid:**
> I chose to use the grid option with 15px because personally, that one was the easiest to have all my elements centered and aligned the way I wanted it to. I did not find the columns and rows option to be helpful since I am designed a website rather than an app.
