# Assignment 7: High Fidelity Prototype
Leah Kim | DH 110

## Overview
### Summary
I created an interactive high fidelity prototype to redesign and improve the original website of Dolmetsch Online, a music theory learning online platform. The prototype is designed to support three tasks, while maintaining UX/UI standards.

### Process
I used Figma to create this prototype and based the design on my sketched low fidelity prototype and interface design from previous assignments. I created a first version of a high fidelity prototype, and then I modified it using my peers' input for a second version.

### Purpose
The goal of this interactive prototype is to evaluate the updated Dolmetsch Online website's interface and functionality. It determines if completing tasks, using the proposed feature, and following the desired interaction flow are simple for the user.


## Tasks
This interactive prototype supports 3 tasks:
1. Going through a lesson and accessing the progress tracker
2. Utilizing the filter function
3. Creating an account and logging in


## Wireflows
For clarity and readability, I separated the flow by task:

### Task 1 Flow:

For this iteration of prototyping, I actually used screen designs that resembled more of my lo-fi prototype. Key traits of this design system include 
rectangular buttons, which aim to establish a more professional feel to the site. However, I quickly noticed some issues after conducting cognitive 
walkthroughs and usability tests.


## Cognitive Walkthrough

### Cognitive Walkthrough:

Overall, I think the cognitive walkthrough went smoothly. To my delight, my two testers were able to easily follow the intended interaction flow, easily completing the 3 proposed tasks. They appreciated the minimalist and straightforward interface design and thought most pages and buttons were clearly labeled. 

However, they did point out some areas of improvement:

1. On the “Permit & License Information” page, the tester indicated that she did not know what to click––the icon or the text. She assumed that the text would be clickable as well, not just the icon.
> Proposed Revision: Adding a separate button and converting the icon into a decorative element

2. The tester struggled with returning to the home page and was confused by some of the back/previous buttons.
> Proposed Revision: Making the “County of Hawai’i” icon a button that leads back to the home page
