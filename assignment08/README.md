### Usability Testing

Usability testing (UT) is an important part of the user-centered design (UCD) process and helps designers assess how easy the user interfaces are to use. By getting feedback from users, you can change people's attitudes about the users and change the design and development process, and ultimately increase the website's effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. In my pilot UT, I tested the website Goodreads for tasks that examine whether a user can find information about books relating to their interests. ...read more

## User Research

I decided to use a combination of two methods: participatory observation and interview, to understand my users better. I interviewed my sister, who is currently a high school student, and decided to read more books during quarantine, but wanted something to keep her accountable. For participatory observation, I observed 2 activities: logging a book by hand and finding a book to read in the Amazon Kindle store, also with my sister. Two interesting insights I found were that she mainly keeps track of books as a creative outlet and a way to share books with her friends. ...read more

## UX Storytelling

The purpose of UX storytelling is to shift your perspective to the user's perspective and see the world how they would see it. Creating personas and their story lets you and your team share the same image of the users. Storytelling also helps filter out any biases you or your interviewees had and focus solely on the users. Thus, drawing from my user research, I came up with three personas, who interact with books differently in their lives. ...read more

	
## Wireframes and Interface Design

Based on my personas, I came up with three features I wanted to implement for them. (1) Simple flow and showing where they are in a particular process. (2) A share button, where users can share any book through SMS, email, Facebook, and other social media websites, or directly through friends they connect with on the app. (3) A book log button where a users can log books in a creative way. ...read more

### Low-fidelity prototype

I came up with a low-fidelity prototype with pencil and paper to implement the three features I came up with. After creating my low-fidelity prototype, I got feedback from a participant to see if she could navigate through the features and flow I created. This let me detect some major problems, as well as any additional features she wanted to see. ...read more

### High-fidelity prototype

Based on the low-fidelity prototype, I created a high-fidelity prototype using Figma. My process of creating this prototype was: (1) referring to the low-fidelity prototype and my personas to create the three features on Figma, (2) a cognitive walkthrough and impression test with three of my classmates, (3) 4 usability tests with my classmates, (4) revision. ...read more

## Evaluation and Revision History

I conducted four usability tests among my classmates to detect major problems and objectively see, from a user's perspective, how the product works. These usability tests were conducted over Zoom and with the permission of the participants, their screen and facial expressions were recorded. ...read more

## Conclusion

Overall, I think I was able to reach my goal of making an app that meets the needs of my three personas. I was able to make revisions after my usability tests, and I was able to experience the process of iterative design first-hand. This was my first time going through a full iterative design process, so I really learned the importance of listening to the users.

At first, I wanted to create a completely new app unrelated to Goodreads, but as I did more research, I noticed how hard it is to come up with a completely new app from scratch. Thus, I decided to build on the basic structure that Goodreads had. However, next time, I think I would like to create a new app. I would also do more field research and interviews to make sure the product I am making is actually reflective of a larger population. After conducting my usability tests for my high-fidelity prototype, participants said they are least likely to use the “book log” feature out of the 3 features I tested. Although I made my revisions after all of the tests were conducted, I think I would also have made changes to the design after each usability test. This would let me test through more designs and keep improving it after each test.
