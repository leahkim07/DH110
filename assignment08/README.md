# Redesigning Dolmetsch Online

## Leah Kim

## Introduction

The goal of this course was to create a UX project that improves upon a music learning website or app for a middle-aged man to easily use and follow. Music learning has evolved over the last few years, adapting to the development of technology. What was previously only available in-person is now widespread on the internet through various learning platforms. However, finding a usable resource for certain demographics can be challenging due to the complexities or design of websites and apps. Therefore, through this project, I aimed to redesign Dolmetsch Online, a music theory website, so that my target demographic can utilize it as a learning resource.

## Design Statement

**The redesigned Dolmetsch Online website serves all ages and learning levels, including middle-aged men, by providing various types of music theory lessons and interactive features that allows learning anytime and anywhere.**

Based on research outlined below, I implemented 3 design features for an improved user experience:
* **Progress Tracker:** allow for music learners to keep track of their learning and progress by mapping out important topics and including subtopics with a progress bar to see how far along they have come
* **Filter Function:** create an extensive possibility of filter options and categorize them easily based on needs that users may have when searching for musical topics. This will allow them to easily narrow down their choices from the thousands of options available to them on the internet. Some examples of those filters are: genre of music, lesson type, sheet music, etc. 
* **Account Function:** allow user to create a profile and log in to keep progress and customize features

## Competitor Analysis

### Heuristics Evaluation

The first step in the process was to conduct a heuristic evaluation of two music-learning websites to see how they follow or do not follow Nielson's 10 Usability Heuristics Evaluation based on a severity ranking of 1 to 3, where 1 is the least severe and 3 is the most severe. The two selected websites were [Dolmetsch Online](https://www.dolmetsch.com/index.htm) and [Teoria](https://www.teoria.com).

Dolmetsch Online performed poorly on 9 out of 10 of the heuristics and had high severity ratings on many of them. It is an outdated and unorganized website that is difficult to navigate even for skilled users. Teoria performed better, but it still had its issues from a heusitics standpoint. 

From these two websites, they were both lacking in the following heuristic categories:
* Visibility of system status
* User control and freedom
* Flexibility and efficiency of use

However, they both did well with the following category:
* Consistency and standards

### Usability Testing

The goal of usability testing (UT) is to improve a product's usability by monitoring and testing consumers and collecting feedback. UT uses a heuristic evaluation to discover specific problems and then tests whether the product is effective, efficient, and satisfactory to users. UT is the best technique to analyze the participant's behaviors and thoughts while observing them navigate the product, as opposed to heuristic evaluations or other evaluation techniques.

In my pilot UT, I tested the website Dolmetsch Online for tasks that examine whether a user can find information about music theory. The user's first thoughts of the website are assessed in the pre-test questionnaire. Three tasks were created and assigned to view usability. The post-test questionnaire measures the level of user satisfaction with the tool in terms of ease, time, and chance of repeating the task. The System Usability Scale assesses a user's perception of the app's usability. The Product Satisfaction Cards indicate how they feel about the site. Google Forms was used for the testing, and I used Zoom and OBS to record the process of UT.

## User Research

### Contextual Inquiry 

I decided to use a combination of two methods, participatory observation and ethnographic research, to understand my users better. The preference of users would be those that are interested in music already and want to learn more or those who want to learn something new. It could also be those who already have knowledge but want to expand on it. With this, expertise of users may vary, but typically, it may be on the beginner to intermediate side.
I conducted participatory observation research with my roommate who fits my target demographic. For the latter, this involved observing a music class, observing music rooms, and observing online videos about music learning.

## UX Storytelling

### Personas and Scenarios

Researchers and designers are reminded through UX Storytelling that the experience must be user-centered. UX storytelling allows researchers to reflect on the underlying feelings and desires that users may have when completing a task and ensure that they are satisfied by the project's results by using think no longer websites based on heuristic principles and user interviews as data points. By designing personas, I was able to think more broadly about the target consumers and better understand how the current system fails to satisfy their needs.

Here is an example of one of the personas:

## Wireframes and Interface Design

Based on my personas, I came up with three features I wanted to implement for them. (1) Simple flow and showing where they are in a particular process. (2) A share button, where users can share any book through SMS, email, Facebook, and other social media websites, or directly through friends they connect with on the app. (3) A book log button where a users can log books in a creative way. ...read more

### Low-fidelity prototype

I came up with a low-fidelity prototype with pencil and paper to implement the three features I came up with. After creating my low-fidelity prototype, I got feedback from a participant to see if she could navigate through the features and flow I created. This let me detect some major problems, as well as any additional features she wanted to see. ...read more

### High-fidelity prototype

Based on the low-fidelity prototype, I created a high-fidelity prototype using Figma. My process of creating this prototype was: (1) referring to the low-fidelity prototype and my personas to create the three features on Figma, (2) a cognitive walkthrough and impression test with three of my classmates, (3) 4 usability tests with my classmates, (4) revision. ...read more

## Evaluation and Revision History

I conducted four usability tests among my classmates to detect major problems and objectively see, from a user's perspective, how the product works. These usability tests were conducted over Zoom and with the permission of the participants, their screen and facial expressions were recorded. ...read more

## Conclusion

Overall, I think I was able to reach my goal of making an app that meets the needs of my three personas. I was able to make revisions after my usability tests, and I was able to experience the process of iterative design first-hand. This was my first time going through a full iterative design process, so I really learned the importance of listening to the users.

At first, I wanted to create a completely new app unrelated to Goodreads, but as I did more research, I noticed how hard it is to come up with a completely new app from scratch. Thus, I decided to build on the basic structure that Goodreads had. However, next time, I think I would like to create a new app. I would also do more field research and interviews to make sure the product I am making is actually reflective of a larger population. After conducting my usability tests for my high-fidelity prototype, participants said they are least likely to use the “book log” feature out of the 3 features I tested. Although I made my revisions after all of the tests were conducted, I think I would also have made changes to the design after each usability test. This would let me test through more designs and keep improving it after each test.
