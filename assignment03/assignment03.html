    <h1> DH110 Assignment 3: Contextual Inquiry </h1>

    <section id="intro">
      <h2> Introductory Steps </h2>
      <h3> Step 1: Specify the main design challenge </h3>
        <b> What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing? </b>
          <p> My project will allow for people to learn about music, specifically music theory, in a self-taught, accessible manner. People can use the free source material to expand on their music knowledge. </p>
        <b> What is the basic need involved for that activity? </b>
          <p> The basic need involved in music learning is finding a new hobby or a new source of learning to expand on one's skills and knowledge. It is also useful to have a better understanding of music, so when someone listens to a song, they are able to pick out key elements from it. </p>
        <b> What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs? </b>
          <p> The current solution to music learning would be taking music classes from an instructor, whether that be private or group lessons. More often than not, people seek out a teacher rather than self-teaching music materials. Another method would be to get music theory books rather than relying on an online resource. </p>
        <b> What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology? </b>
          <p> Some limitations that are addressed and improved through technology is again the accessibility of music learning. Music classes are often very expensive, so it is a big investment to learn music. Therefore, most of the time, people take one, maybe two, classes a week, which is consistent but does not allow for maximum growth. Another restriction is time. The constraint of time in classes being limited to an hour or two once a week can prevent quick progress. Technology, however, makes it easier to learn music on a daily basis, so people are getting more practice in on a regular basis. It can also allow for lessons and practice to be cheaper if not already free. </p>
      <h3> Step 2: Identify target users </h3>
        <b> What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) </b>
          <p> The demographics of users could be virtually anyone. To refine it though, it would be someone capable of accessing the internet of any age. The preference of users would be those that are interested in music already and want to learn more or those who want to learn something new. It could also be those who already have knowledge but want to expand on it. With this, expertise of users may vary, but typically, it may be on the beginner to intermediate side. </p>
        <b> Where would the users do that activity? </b>
          <p> Users would learn music in the comfort of their own homes or where the internet is accessible. They can do it anywhere where they can reach the website. </p>
        <b> What would the users do to complete that activity? </b>
          <p> Users would navigate resources and lessons to learn about music theory. They can scroll through the music dictionary and take notes or look at sheet music and apply music theory knowledge. </p>
      <h3> Step 3: Pick observation method(s) </h3>
        <b> Participatory Observation </b>
          <p> I conducted participatory observation research with my roommate who fits my target demographic details. Please find the materials used in the following section. </p>
        <b> Ethnographic Research </b>
          <p> This involved observing a music class, observing music rooms, and observing online videos about music learning. The following are my key takeaways. </p>
          <ul>
            <li> People in traditional music classes were typically children, ranging from age 5-12. I saw mostly private lessons, and some small group practices. </li>
            <li> Based on the schedule, most kids took an hour long class once a week. They are given a piece to practice on their own at home. </li>
            <li> Music rooms had older students, ranging from upper middle school to high school. They are able to reserve rooms for self-practice for an hour to two hour windows. </li>
            <li> Adults usually took group lessons, and these group lessons were less frequently offered. </li>
            <li> Online resources are used up to a certain point, but after a certain level of proficiency, they become less useful. </li>
            <li> Apps and websites are usually used by young adults. </li>
            <li> Overall, depending on someone's age, their way of learning music typically varies. </li>
          </ul>

      <h3> Interesting Quotes </h3>
        <ul>
          <li> "And typically those pieces are around like, maybe like four pages long, but it's just really technical. And I would say, like, a month to kind of get down, like the notes and have good muscle memory. But then if you want to go deeper and further on beyond that, then I think maybe around like six months, maybe." </li>
          <li> "Nowadays, it's really accessible to just learn, like, there's so many videos out there, internet, it's just a huge rabbit hole that you can just go on and like you can literally learn an instrument yourself." </li>
          <li> "I think for me, in my experience, staying true to the original intent of the composer, I think that's very difficult if especially when you really want to play a certain piece a certain way." </li>
          <li> "I think you can do a balance of both. Both can be synergistic. You can definitely learn the fundamentals such as like theory on your own online, but having like the face to face in person interaction with someone show showing you the technique. And seeing that visually versus just reading about it on a website is definitely so much more helpful, and can definitely improve your playing." </li>
          <li> "Yeah, I would say like online resources are also very, very important just because you also need to go out and see and branch off and actually see how others are performing a certain piece of music." </li>
        </ul>

      <h2> Reflection </h2>
        <p> I had another positive experience in this interview with Allison. I did not expect it run closer to half an hour, but I found myself very interested and engaged in the conversation, and I think my participant did as well. She provided a lot of great insight and expert knowledge to the topic of music learning, and I learned a lot from it. I believe that this was a great tool to get more information beyond just UT or heuristic testing because this goes much more in depth and provides more context. Nonetheless, I think all three provide useful data. I believe I prepared a lot of good questions that kept the conversation active, and I think the responses provided were also great and thorough. I did not run into any distractions this time, but I did have a minor technical difficulty with the recording pausing, but this was an easy fix. Overall, I learned a lot and enjoyed the process. </p>
