# DH150 Assignment 6: Low-Fidelity Prototype by Lillian Nguyen

## Overview

### Purpose 
Low-fidelity prototyping is a quick and low-cost way to design and test the contents of an artifact before fully investing time and money into developing the product. This allows you to get feedback from users, uncover problems early on, and make changes during the beginning stages of the design cycle. 

By making low-fidelity prototypes for my project, I can test the features of my design with users and make further improvements before working on the high-fidelity prototypes.

### User Research
Based on my contextual inquiry, I will focus on these three research questions:
* How might we improve the report system for better tracking?
* How might we bring locals together to contribute toward keeping San Jose clean and safe?
* How might we create an intuitive design so users can accomplish tasks quickly and effortlessly?

Here is more information on the [user research](https://github.com/lilliannguyen97/DH150/blob/master/Assignments/A04/README.md).

### Personas and Scenarios
I created personas and scenarios centered around features that would solve each research question.
* A man with medium technical literacy and wants to have transparent and timely updates on his reports.
* A new undergraduate with high technical literacy and wants to browse and search for other reports in her community.
* An elderly woman with low technical literacy and wants to submit reports quickly and effortlessly.

Here is more information on the [personas and scenarios](https://github.com/lilliannguyen97/DH150/blob/master/Assignments/A05/README.md).

### Tasks/Features
1. Make a report
1. Check my reports
1. Check other reports with filter/advanced search

### Reflection
I enjoyed drawing the wireframes and designing how I'd like it to look like. When I want to add some buttoms or features, I searched online to see how they look like that way I can replicate it. Putting my ideas onto paper is harder than I thought but it is a fun process nonetheless. When I draw the wireflows, I can see what I need to add to the wireframes. From testing the prototype, I found even more missed elements in the wireframes, such as a **Next** button rather than just a **Skip** button.  

The next time I create wireframes and wireflows, I would make a flow chart with just words so I can visualize the entire sequence in order to include all the buttons. For this prototype, I would need to add all the buttons and draw the wireframes for all the other buttons I included but were not going to be tested. If I need to be more detailed, I would draw dropdown menus to wireframes that have them too. 

By only creating one type of sequence (e.g. one sequence to make a report on an abandoned car), I guide the participant into pressing the only button they can choose so I can realize the importance of drawing all the wireframes of the app that way they can have a near complete experience. I would also have the participant draw the flow and mark the mistakes/confusion on the actual wireframe itself instead of doing it for them.
