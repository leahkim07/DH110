# Low-Fidelity Prototype by Leah Kim

## Overview

### Purpose 
Low-fidelity prototyping is a low-cost and quick technique to create and test the contents of an artifact before committing a significant amount of time and money into its development. This helps you to collect user feedback, identify problems early on, and make adjustments within the design cycle's early stages. I can test the features of my design with users and make further modifications before working on the high-fidelity prototypes by creating low-fidelity prototypes for my project.

### User Research
I will focus on these three research questions based on my contextual inquiry:
* How can we track user progress with lessons and tutorials?
* How can we improve the organization of the website or making things easier to find?
* How can we allow more advanced users to make use of this resource?

Here is more information on the [user research](https://leahkim07.github.io/DH110/assignment03/assignment03.html).

### Personas and Scenarios
I created personas and scenarios centered around features that would solve each research question.
* An older man with low technical literacy and wants to learn from scratch about music.
* A teenage girl with moderate technical literacy and wants to browse and search for specific tutorials.
* A man with high technical literacy and wants to relearn music.

### Reflection
I had fun creating and drawing the wireframes and wireflows, as well as designing everything to what I wanted it to be. When I want to add some features, I researched online to see similar examples so I can mirror it. It was difficult to create a cohesive story with these wireframes and wireflows, but I had a great learning experience from it. From testing the prototype, I found a lot of things that I needed to add in the wireframes. In the future, I would make a flow chart as a thinking map, so I can visualize the entire sequence in order to include all necessary elements. For this prototype, I would need to add all the features and draw the wireframes for all the other features I included but were not going to be tested. I guided the participant into following one exact sequence only for simplicity sakes, so I can realize the importance of drawing all the wireframes of the app that way they can have a near complete experience. I also would have the participant draw the flow and mark the errors on the actual wireframe itself instead of doing it for them to create a more holistic testing experience.
